### Eliud Kipchoge's Record-Making Marathon Pace and the Time to Run the Distance Between Earth and Moon

- Eliud Kipchoge, a Kenyan long-distance runner, set the world record in the marathon with a time of 2:01:09 at the Berlin Marathon. This translates to an average pace of approximately 21.18 km/h (13.16 mph). This remarkable feat was achieved in a highly controlled environment, showcasing Kipchoge's exceptional physical and mental capabilities. In another notable event, the INEOS 1:59 Challenge in Vienna, Kipchoge ran a full marathon distance (42.195 km) in under two hours, clocking in at 1:59:40.2. However, this performance is not recognized as an official world record due to the use of a closed course, multiple pacers, and laser-guided technology, which are not standard conditions for official records. Despite this, Kipchoge's achievement in Vienna demonstrated that human potential can be pushed beyond previously thought limits, inspiring the running community and beyond.

- The minimum perigee value, which is the closest approach of the Moon to Earth, is 363,104 kilometers (225,623 miles). This value is crucial for calculating the time it would take for a person to run the distance between the Earth and the Moon. Using Kipchoge's record-making marathon pace of 21.18 km/h, we can calculate the time required to cover this distance. The formula to calculate the time is: 
  \[
  \text{Time (hours)} = \frac{\text{Distance (km)}}{\text{Pace (km/h)}}
  \]
  Substituting the values, we get:
  \[
  \text{Time (hours)} = \frac{363,104 \text{ km}}{21.18 \text{ km/h}} \approx 17,144.5 \text{ hours}
  \]
  Rounding this to the nearest 1,000 hours, it would take approximately 17,000 hours for Kipchoge to run the distance between the Earth and the Moon at his record-making marathon pace. [Citation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon#Orbit_and_rotation)
