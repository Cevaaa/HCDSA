### Eliud Kipchoge's Record-Making Marathon Pace and the Distance to the Moon

- Eliud Kipchoge's fastest official marathon time is 2:01:09, which he achieved at the 2022 Berlin Marathon. This performance set a new world record, shaving 30 seconds off his previous record of 2:01:39, also set in Berlin in 2018. During the 2022 Berlin Marathon, Kipchoge ran at an average speed of 21.02 km/h, or 2 minutes and 52 seconds per kilometer. His average pace per 5km was clocked at an impressive 14:21.4. This pace is significantly faster than the general average for a Six Star finisher, which is 4:03. Kipchoge's consistent and exceptional performance in marathons has made him one of the most successful long-distance runners in history.

- The minimum perigee value (closest approach) of the Moon to Earth is approximately 363,104 kilometers. This distance is crucial for various astronomical and scientific studies, as it affects the gravitational forces and tidal effects on Earth. The perigee and apogee (the farthest point in the Moon's orbit from Earth) are important in understanding the Moon's orbit and its impact on Earth. These values have been used in historical and contemporary studies to model the Moon's behavior and predict phenomena such as eclipses and tides.

- To calculate the time it would take for Eliud Kipchoge to run the distance between the Earth and the Moon at his record-making marathon pace, we need to use the minimum perigee value of 363,104 kilometers and his average speed of 21.02 km/h. The formula to calculate the time is: 
  \[
  \text{Time (hours)} = \frac{\text{Distance (km)}}{\text{Speed (km/h)}}
  \]
  Substituting the values, we get:
  \[
  \text{Time (hours)} = \frac{363,104 \text{ km}}{21.02 \text{ km/h}} \approx 17,274.4 \text{ hours}
  \]
  Rounding this to the nearest 1,000 hours, it would take Kipchoge approximately 17,000 hours to run the distance between the Earth and the Moon at his record-making marathon pace. [Citation](https://www.olympics.com/en/news/how-fast-was-eliud-kipchoge-world-record)
