### Eliud Kipchoge's Record-Making Marathon Pace and the Time to Run from Earth to the Moon at Perigee

- Eliud Kipchoge, one of the greatest marathon runners in history, set a world record at the 2018 BMW Berlin Marathon with a time of 2:01:39. This performance not only solidified his status as a top athlete but also extended his record for the most men's Abbott World Marathon Majors victories to eight. Kipchoge's pace during this race was exceptional, and he maintained a consistent speed throughout the event. His average pace for the 2018 Berlin Marathon was approximately 4.72 km/h (or 2.93 mph). This calculation is derived from the total distance of 42.195 kilometers divided by the time of 2 hours, 1 minute, and 39 seconds.

- The minimum perigee value, which is the closest approach of the Moon to Earth, is crucial for our calculation. According to the Wikipedia page on the Moon, the minimum perigee value is approximately 363,104 kilometers. This value is used to determine the distance Kipchoge would need to cover if he were to run from the Earth to the Moon at his record-making marathon pace.

- To calculate the time it would take for Eliud Kipchoge to run the distance between the Earth and the Moon at its closest approach, we use the following steps:
  1. Convert Kipchoge's marathon pace to a consistent unit. From the 2018 Berlin Marathon, his pace was 4.72 km/h.
  2. Use the minimum perigee value of 363,104 kilometers.
  3. Calculate the time in hours: \( \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{363,104 \text{ km}}{4.72 \text{ km/h}} \approx 76,928.81 \text{ hours} \).
  4. Round the result to the nearest 1000 hours: 77,000 hours.

Thus, if Eliud Kipchoge could maintain his record-making marathon pace indefinitely, it would take him approximately 77,000 hours to run the distance between the Earth and the Moon at its closest approach.
