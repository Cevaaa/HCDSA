### Eliud Kipchoge's Record-Making Marathon Pace and the Time to Run from Earth to Moon at Perigee

- Eliud Kipchoge, a two-time Olympic champion (Rio 2016 and Tokyo 2020), former world record holder, and 5000m world champion, is renowned for his exceptional marathon performances. His most notable achievement was during the INEOS 1:59 Challenge in Vienna, where he ran the marathon distance in a time of 1:59:40, becoming the first person in history to run a marathon in under two hours. Although this feat was not recognized as an official world record due to the use of rotating pacers, drinks being handed to him, and it being effectively a time trial rather than a race, it demonstrated the extraordinary potential of human endurance. Kipchoge's average pace during this event was 4 minutes and 34 seconds per mile, which translates to approximately 21.1 km/h [^1][^2][^3][^4][^5].
  
- The minimum perigee value, which is the closest approach of the Moon to Earth, is 363,104 kilometers. This value is crucial for calculating the hypothetical time it would take for someone running at Kipchoge's record-making pace to cover the distance between the Earth and the Moon. To determine the time, we need to convert the distance into the same units as the pace. Given that Kipchoge's pace is 21.1 km/h, we can calculate the total time required as follows:

  \[
  \text{Time (hours)} = \frac{\text{Distance (km)}}{\text{Pace (km/h)}} = \frac{363,104 \text{ km}}{21.1 \text{ km/h}} \approx 17,208.72 \text{ hours}
  \]

  Rounding this to the nearest thousand hours, it would take approximately 17,000 hours for Eliud Kipchoge to run the distance from Earth to the Moon at its closest approach [^6].

- The historical context and significance of the perigee and apogee in lunar orbit studies are important for understanding the dynamics of the Earth-Moon system. The perigee and apogee are the points in the Moon's orbit around the Earth where it is closest and farthest, respectively. These points are not fixed but vary slightly due to the gravitational influences of the Sun and other planets. The study of these variations has been crucial for various scientific and practical applications, such as predicting tides, planning space missions, and understanding the long-term stability of the Earth-Moon system. The minimum perigee value of 363,104 kilometers is a key parameter in these studies, providing a baseline for the closest approach of the Moon to Earth [^7].

- Comparative analysis of other elite long-distance runners' paces and their hypothetical time to cover the same distance provides a broader perspective on Kipchoge's performance. For instance, Kenenisa Bekele, another top marathon runner, holds the second-fastest marathon time of 2:01:41, which translates to an average pace of approximately 20.8 km/h. If Bekele were to run the same distance at his pace, it would take him approximately 17,456.9 hours, or about 17,000 hours when rounded to the nearest thousand. This comparison highlights the marginal difference in performance and the significant impact of even slight variations in pace over such a vast distance [^8].

- The potential physiological and physical limitations if a human were to attempt such a feat are immense. Running for 17,000 hours without rest is beyond the limits of human endurance. The energy requirements alone would be astronomical, with the body needing to sustain a continuous high-intensity effort. Additionally, the physical stress on the muscles, bones, and joints, as well as the psychological toll, would be unsustainable. Scientific studies have shown that the human body has a finite capacity for sustained exertion, and prolonged periods of intense activity can lead to severe health issues, including muscle damage, dehydration, and cardiovascular strain. Therefore, while Kipchoge's performance is a testament to human potential, the hypothetical scenario of running to the Moon is purely theoretical and not feasible within the current understanding of human physiology [^9][^10].
