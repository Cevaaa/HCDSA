# Eliud Kipchoge's Marathon Pace and the Distance to the Moon

- Eliud Kipchoge, a renowned long-distance runner, set a world record in the 2018 BMW Berlin Marathon with a time of 2:01:39. This performance not only solidified his status as one of the greatest marathon runners but also extended his record for the most men's Abbott World Marathon Majors (AbbottWMM) victories to eight. Kipchoge's pace during this race was approximately 4:40 per mile, which translates to about 1:08-1:10 per lap on a standard track [1]. His consistent performance and ability to maintain such a high pace over the 26.2 miles of a marathon highlight his exceptional physical and mental capabilities. In another notable achievement, Kipchoge became the first human to run a sub-two-hour marathon in Vienna, Austria, with a time of 1:59:40. This feat required him to run 5km segments in 14:13, eight times in a row, demonstrating an incredible level of endurance and speed [2].

- The minimum perigee value of the Moon, which is the closest distance between the Earth and the Moon, is 363,104 kilometers. This value is crucial for calculating the hypothetical scenario where Kipchoge maintains his record-making marathon pace indefinitely to cover the distance to the Moon. To determine how many thousand hours it would take him to run this distance, we need to convert his marathon pace into a consistent speed and then use that to calculate the total time [3].

- To provide historical context, Kipchoge's performance in the 2018 Berlin Marathon and his subsequent sub-two-hour marathon in Vienna are significant milestones in the history of marathon running. Prior to Kipchoge's 2:00:25 in 2017, there were serious questions about whether a human could run under two hours for a marathon distance. Kipchoge's achievements have not only broken records but also inspired a new generation of runners and challenged the limits of human endurance. His performance in the 2022 Berlin Marathon, where he completed the race in 2:01:09, further solidified his position as one of the greatest marathon runners of all time. His consistency and ability to push the boundaries of what is possible in long-distance running have made him a legend in the sport [4].

- Maintaining a marathon pace for an extended period, such as the time required to run the distance to the Moon, has significant physical and physiological implications. The human body is not designed to sustain such high levels of exertion for prolonged periods. Factors such as muscle fatigue, dehydration, and the risk of injury would make it impossible for even the most elite athletes to maintain a marathon pace for more than a few hours. Additionally, the psychological toll of such a feat cannot be underestimated. The mental fortitude required to push through the pain and exhaustion of a marathon is already immense, and extending this to a much longer duration would be beyond the capabilities of any human [5].

- When calculating the time required to cover the distance to the Moon, different methods can be used, such as using average speed versus instantaneous speed. Kipchoge's average speed during his record-breaking marathons can be calculated by dividing the total distance (42.195 km) by the total time (2:01:39). This gives an average speed of approximately 20.03 km/h. Using this speed, the time required to cover the minimum perigee distance of 363,104 km can be calculated as follows: 363,104 km / 20.03 km/h = 18,127.5 hours. Rounding this to the nearest 1000 hours, it would take Kipchoge approximately 18000 hours to run the distance to the Moon at his record-making marathon pace. This calculation assumes a constant speed and does not account for the need for rest, nutrition, and other practical considerations [6].
