### Eliud Kipchoge's Record-Making Marathon Pace and the Time to Run the Distance Between Earth and Moon at Perigee

- Eliud Kipchoge, a Kenyan long-distance runner, holds the world record for the fastest marathon. In 2018, at the Berlin Marathon, he set a world record with a time of 2:01:39. This translates to an average pace of approximately 20.8 km/h (12.9 mph). [Citation](https://www.worldmarathonmajors.com/content-hub/kipchoge-shatters-world-record)

- The minimum perigee value, which is the closest approach of the Moon to Earth, is 363,104 kilometers (225,623 miles). This value is documented on the Wikipedia page for the Moon. [Citation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon)

- To calculate the time it would take Eliud Kipchoge to run the distance between the Earth and the Moon at its closest approach, we use the following formula:
  \[
  \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Pace}}
  \]
  Substituting the values:
  \[
  \text{Time} = \frac{363,104 \text{ km}}{20.8 \text{ km/h}} \approx 17,457 \text{ hours}
  \]
  Rounding this to the nearest 1,000 hours, it would take Eliud Kipchoge approximately 17,000 hours to run the distance between the Earth and the Moon at its closest approach. [Citation](https://www.olympics.com/en/news/how-fast-was-eliud-kipchoge-world-record)

- The historical context and significance of the perigee and apogee in lunar orbit studies are crucial for understanding the Moon's gravitational influence on Earth and for planning space missions. The perigee, being the closest point, and the apogee, being the farthest point, are used to model the Moon's elliptical orbit around Earth. These points have been studied extensively since ancient times, with significant contributions from astronomers like Johannes Kepler and Isaac Newton. [Citation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon)

- Comparative analysis of other elite long-distance runners' paces and their hypothetical time to cover the same distance can provide insights into the exceptional performance of Eliud Kipchoge. For instance, Kenenisa Bekele, another top marathon runner, has a personal best of 2:01:41, which translates to an average pace of approximately 20.8 km/h (12.9 mph), similar to Kipchoge's. However, even with this pace, Bekele would also take approximately 17,000 hours to cover the same distance. This comparison highlights the extraordinary nature of Kipchoge's achievement.

- Potential physiological and physical limitations if a human were to attempt such a feat, including energy requirements and endurance constraints, are significant. Running such a distance would require an enormous amount of energy, estimated to be in the range of several million calories. Additionally, the human body would face severe challenges, such as muscle fatigue, dehydration, and potential organ damage. The continuous running without rest would also lead to sleep deprivation and mental stress. These factors make it clear that, while theoretically possible, such a feat is beyond the current physiological capabilities of humans.
