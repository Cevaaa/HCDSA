### Eliud Kipchoge's Record-Making Marathon Pace and the Time to Run from Earth to Moon at Perigee

- Eliud Kipchoge, a Kenyan long-distance runner, holds the world record for the fastest official marathon time. In the 2022 Berlin Marathon, Kipchoge ran at an average speed of 21.02 km/h, finishing the race in 2:01:09. This pace is equivalent to 2 minutes 52 seconds per kilometer. During the race, his average pace per 5km was clocked at an impressive 14:21.4. By the halfway point, his time of 59:51 was close to a minute faster than the pace of his own previous official world record of 2:01:39 set on the same course in 2018. Between kilometers 35 and 40, Kipchoge's pace slowed slightly to an average of 2:57 per kilometer, but he managed to increase his pace over the final 2.195km, posting an average time of 2:52 per kilometer, just two seconds slower than his fastest average kilometer times in the race.

- The minimum perigee value (closest approach) of the Moon to Earth is 363,104 km. This value is used to calculate the distance between the Earth and the Moon at its closest point. [Citation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_of_the_Moon)

To determine how many thousand hours it would take Eliud Kipchoge to run the distance between the Earth and the Moon at its closest approach, we can use the following calculation:

- Distance to the Moon at perigee: 363,104 km
- Kipchoge's average speed: 21.02 km/h

Using these values, the time required to cover the distance can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Time (hours)} = \frac{\text{Distance (km)}}{\text{Speed (km/h)}} = \frac{363,104 \text{ km}}{21.02 \text{ km/h}} \approx 17,276.8 \text{ hours} \]

Rounding this result to the nearest 1,000 hours, it would take Kipchoge approximately 17,000 hours to run the distance between the Earth and the Moon at its closest approach.
