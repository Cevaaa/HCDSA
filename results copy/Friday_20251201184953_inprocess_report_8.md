### Eliud Kipchoge's Record-Making Marathon Pace and the Time to Run from Earth to Moon at Perigee

- **Eliud Kipchoge's Record-Making Marathon Pace:**
  - Eliud Kipchoge, a two-time Olympic champion (Rio 2016 and Tokyo 2020), is known for his exceptional marathon performances. In 2019, he ran a marathon in under two hours during the INEOS 1:59 Challenge in Vienna, finishing with a time of 1:59:40. Although this event was not an official world record due to the controlled conditions, it demonstrated his extraordinary capabilities. His official world record in the marathon was set at the 2022 BMW Berlin Marathon, where he clocked an impressive 2:01:09. To convert this pace into kilometers per hour (km/h), we can use the formula: 
  \[
  \text{Pace (km/h)} = \frac{\text{Distance (km)}}{\text{Time (hours)}}
  \]
  For the 2022 Berlin Marathon, the distance is 42.195 km, and the time is 2:01:09, which is 2.018611 hours. Therefore, the pace is:
  \[
  \text{Pace (km/h)} = \frac{42.195}{2.018611} \approx 20.90 \, \text{km/h}
  \]
  This pace of approximately 20.90 km/h is the record-making marathon pace that Kipchoge achieved. [Citation](https://worldathletics.org/news/report/eliud-kipchoge-world-record-berlin-marathon-2022)

- **The Minimum Perigee Value of the Moon to Earth:**
  - The minimum perigee value, which is the closest approach of the Moon to Earth, is crucial for our calculation. According to the Wikipedia page on the Moon, the minimum perigee value is approximately 356,400 kilometers. This value is used to determine the shortest distance between the Earth and the Moon.

- **Calculation of the Time to Run from Earth to Moon at Perigee:**
  - To calculate the time it would take for Eliud Kipchoge to run the distance from Earth to the Moon at his record-making marathon pace, we use the following formula:
  \[
  \text{Time (hours)} = \frac{\text{Distance (km)}}{\text{Pace (km/h)}}
  \]
  Substituting the values, we get:
  \[
  \text{Time (hours)} = \frac{356,400 \, \text{km}}{20.90 \, \text{km/h}} \approx 17,052.63 \, \text{hours}
  \]
  Rounding this to the nearest 1000 hours, the time it would take Kipchoge to run the distance from Earth to the Moon at perigee is approximately 17,000 hours.

**Work Log:**
- The knowledge gap filled is the calculation of the time it would take for Eliud Kipchoge to run the distance from Earth to the Moon at its closest approach (perigee). This was achieved by using the tavily-search tool to find Kipchoge's record-making marathon pace and the minimum perigee value of the Moon. The input parameters included specific queries for Kipchoge's world record pace and the perigee value, which were then used to perform the necessary calculations.
