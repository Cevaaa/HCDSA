## Eliud Kipchoge's Record-Making Marathon Pace and the Distance to the Moon

- **Eliud Kipchoge's record-making marathon pace:** In October 2019, Eliud Kipchoge achieved the historic feat of running a marathon in under two hours during the INEOS 1:59 Challenge in Vienna. He covered 26.2 miles (42.195 kilometers) in 1 hour, 59 minutes, and 40 seconds. This translates to an average pace of 4 minutes and 34 seconds per mile, or approximately 21.1 kilometers per hour (km/h). While this event was not recognized as an official world record due to the use of pacers, laser-guided technology, and a closed course, it demonstrated the incredible potential of human endurance and set a new standard for long-distance running.

- **The minimum perigee value (closest approach) of the Moon to Earth:** The minimum perigee value, which is the closest approach of the Moon to Earth, is 363,104 kilometers. This value is crucial for calculating the distance that Kipchoge would need to cover if he were to run from the Earth to the Moon at his record-making pace. The perigee is the point in the Moon's orbit where it is nearest to the Earth, and this distance varies slightly due to the elliptical nature of the lunar orbit.

- **Historical context and significance of the perigee and apogee in lunar orbit studies:** The study of the Moon's perigee and apogee has been significant in understanding the dynamics of the Earth-Moon system. The perigee, being the closest point, and the apogee, being the farthest point, have been used to model the gravitational interactions between the Earth and the Moon. These points are also important in predicting phenomena such as tides and eclipses. The variation in the Moon's distance from the Earth affects the strength of the gravitational pull, which in turn influences the height of tides on Earth. Historically, the perigee and apogee have been studied by astronomers and mathematicians to refine models of celestial mechanics. [Citation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_of_the_Moon)

- **Comparative analysis of other elite long-distance runners' paces and their hypothetical time to cover the same distance:** To compare Kipchoge's pace with other elite long-distance runners, we can consider the world record times for the marathon. For instance, Brigid Kosgei holds the women's world record with a time of 2:14:04, which translates to an average pace of about 19.6 km/h. If Kosgei were to maintain her world record pace, it would take her approximately 8,724,000 hours to cover the distance from the Earth to the Moon at its closest approach. This comparison highlights the exceptional nature of Kipchoge's achievement and the significant difference in pace between the top male and female marathon runners.

- **Potential physiological and physical limitations if a human were to attempt such a feat, including energy requirements and endurance constraints:** Attempting to run the distance from the Earth to the Moon, even at Kipchoge's record pace, would be an impossible feat for a human due to the extreme physical and physiological limitations. The human body requires a constant supply of energy, primarily in the form of carbohydrates and fats, to sustain prolonged physical activity. Running such a distance would require an astronomical amount of energy, far beyond what the human body can store or consume. Additionally, the human body is subject to various endurance constraints, including muscle fatigue, dehydration, and the risk of injury. Even with optimal nutrition and hydration, the cumulative stress on the body would lead to severe health issues, making it impossible to maintain such a pace over such an extended period.
