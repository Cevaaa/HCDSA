### Eliud Kipchoge's Record-Making Marathon Pace and the Time to Run from Earth to Moon

- Eliud Kipchoge, a Kenyan long-distance runner, set a world record in the 2018 Berlin Marathon with a time of 2:01:39. This equates to an average pace of approximately 20.8 km/h. To calculate this, we use the formula: \[ \text{Pace (km/h)} = \frac{\text{Distance (km)}}{\text{Time (hours)}} \] For a marathon distance of 42.195 km, Kipchoge's time of 2:01:39 (which is 2.0275 hours) gives us: \[ \text{Pace (km/h)} = \frac{42.195}{2.0275} \approx 20.8 \, \text{km/h} \] [Citation](https://www.worldmarathonmajors.com/content-hub/kipchoge-shatters-world-record)

- The minimum perigee value, which is the closest approach of the Moon to Earth, is approximately 363,104 kilometers. This value is derived from the Wikipedia page on the Moon, which provides the range of lunar distances. [Citation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon#Orbit_and_rotation)

- To determine how many thousand hours it would take for Eliud Kipchoge to run the distance between the Earth and the Moon at his record-making pace, we use the following calculation: \[ \text{Time (hours)} = \frac{\text{Distance (km)}}{\text{Pace (km/h)}} \] Substituting the values, we get: \[ \text{Time (hours)} = \frac{363,104}{20.8} \approx 17,457 \, \text{hours} \] Rounding this to the nearest thousand hours, it would take approximately 17,000 hours for Kipchoge to run the distance between the Earth and the Moon at his record-making pace.
